# Database-Management-for-Event-Organization
 
 # Overview
EventOrg is a hypothetical company whose goal is to provide to the public the 
best experience possible when wanting to host an event. Since organizing any 
sort of event or get together can be troublesome and is the least fun part of 
the experience, EventOrg allows its customers to select the criteria for their 
ideal rendez-vous and handles all the vicissitudes that come with organizing 
an event, so that they just have to worry about enjoying their time.
The customers can also choose the food and drinks they want among the 
other options that they have for their events.
The company EventOrg asked us to represent their internal structure with a 
database and ultimately to create a product through which their clients could 
book an event, just the way they wanted.
